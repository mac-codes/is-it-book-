#Is It Book?
##Description
This is a full-stack web application that uses machine learning to classify images as either book covers or not book covers. It allows users to upload an image and see if it's a book cover or not. The app is built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

##Installation
To use this application, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.

Clone the repository:
bash

`git clone https://github.com/mac-codes/is-it-book-.git`
Install the dependencies for the server:

`cd is-it-book-/server`
`npm install`
Install the dependencies for the client:

`cd ../client`
`npm install`
Start the MongoDB server:
`mongod`
Start the server:

`cd ../server`
`npm start`
Start the client:

`cd ../client`
`npm start`
The client will be running on http://localhost:3000 and the server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

##Usage
To use the application, open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. You'll see a page with a form to upload an image. Select an image and click the "Submit" button. The app will use machine learning to classify the image and display the result.
